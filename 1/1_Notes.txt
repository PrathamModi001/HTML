1. Always have only 1 h1 in the document and never use h1-h6 for size purposes we can always use css to change the font size and everything.

2.Always have paragraph enclose a few set of lines. Creating box like enclosures is important and recommended.

3. We can also have nested lists. i.e. lists inside lists, ordered or unordered.

4. We should only add images through html we should not use width and height attributes of the img tagin html. It should be solely done through css.
