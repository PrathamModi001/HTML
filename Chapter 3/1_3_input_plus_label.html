        <!-- This is a server related feature which specifies where this form will be sent to -->

        <form action="/tacos">
            <!-- http://127.0.0.1:5500/tacos?full_name=PrathamModi&password=qwerty&rang=%23260303&number=69
            read the url again
        since i added the username as PrathamModi and password as qwerty and so on...
    we can see that the part about tacos comes from form action
after ? the full_name = {value}&password={value}.... & is the connecting link between the different fields of the form.-->
